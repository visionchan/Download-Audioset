# Download-Audioset
This repository is for Chinese researchers to download audio and video data from the AudioSet. You should use a Global Proxy.

Also, this repository is based on AudioSet_downloader improvements, thanks to their contributions! you can get the AudioSet_downloader code from here: https://github.com/AmirSh15/AudioSet_downloader.

Please change somewhere of main.py. So, you'd be able to run it.
