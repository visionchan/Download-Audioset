# Download-Audioset
This repository is for Chinese researchers to download audio and video data from the AudioSet. I just wanted to let you know that you should use a Global Proxy.

Also, this repository is based on AudioSet_downloader improvements, thanks to their contributions! you can get the AudioSet_downloader code from here: https://github.com/AmirSh15/AudioSet_downloader.
